# BDD Sample using cucumber-cpp for CppEurope 2019

This is an example used by Thomas Sundberg and created in collaboration with Alex Bolboaca, showing how to use [cucumber-cpp](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-cpp) to run BDD features in C++. To compile cucumber-cpp, we've created [cucumber-cpp-vagrant-build](https://github.com/MozaicWorks/cucumber-cpp-vagrant-build) that provides a repeatable compilation process using a Vagrant virtual machine.

## How to run it

### Using vagrant

The easiest way to run the sample is to use the vagrant virtual machine included in the example. You will need first to have vagrant installed. Then simply run the following commands:

~~~~
# Install the required libraries and tools
vagrant up
# Connect to the virtual machine through ssh
vagrant ssh
# Navigate to the source code mount target
cd /vagrant
# Compile and run the tests
make
~~~~

### On Ubuntu 18.04

You can also run the tests directly on Ubuntu 18.04. Simply run `sudo provision.sh`; it will install the required dependencies. Then run `make`.

### On other systems (not tested)

On other Linux distributions or on MacOS you should be able to run the tests by installing:

* cucumber
* boost
* and g++

and by running `make`. 

On Windows, you will need in addition to this to compile cucumber-cpp, and modify the makefile depending on your compiler. Or just use the Ubuntu subsystem.

## Expected results

After running make, you should see a screen detailing the results of the tests, something like this:

~~~~
vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:/vagrant$ make
g++ -I./cucumber-cpp/include -L./cucumber-cpp/lib ./features/step_definitions/StepsDefinitionRunner.cpp -lcucumber-cpp -lboost_unit_test_framework -lboost_program_options -lboost_system -lboost_regex -lboost_filesystem -lboost_thread -o toDoListFeaturesTest
./toDoListFeaturesTest >/dev/null &
cucumber ./features/todo-list.feature
Feature: In order to remember what to do, one might need a todo list

  Scenario: Remeber to buy food for the cat                # ./features/todo-list.feature:4
    Given that we are out food for the cat                 # Steps.cpp:13
    When Thomas adds buy food for the cat to his todo list # Steps.cpp:16
    Then should the todo list contain buy food for the cat # Steps.cpp:21

1 scenario (1 passed)
3 steps (3 passed)
